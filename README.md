RPN Calculator
==============
This is a ruby library for calculating expressions in Reverse Polish Notation.  This program can resolves operator precedence accuratly.  For example, it converts `1 2 + 3 *` to `(1 + 2) * 3`.  I implemented this program using `method_missing` to keep the code clean and elegant.
